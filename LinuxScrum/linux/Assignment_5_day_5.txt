  3. explain absolute and relative path

  Ans:-

 # Absolute Path:-

An absolute path is the complete path to a file or directory from the root directory. It always starts with the root directory, which is denoted by a forward slash (/). Absolute paths provide the exact location of a file or directory in the file system, regardless of the current working directory.

Examples of Absolute Paths:-

1.Root Directory:
/

2.Home Directory:
/home/user

3.Specific File:
/home/user/Documents/report.txt

4.System Directory:
/usr/bin

# Relative Path:-

A relative path is a path to a file or directory relative to the current working directory. It does not start with a forward slash (/). Relative paths are shorter and more convenient when working within a specific directory structure.

Examples of Relative Paths:-

1.Current Directory:
.

2.Parent Directory:
..

3.Sibling Directory (if you are in /home/user and want to go to /home/user/Documents):
Documents

4.Specific File (if you are in /home/user and want to access /home/user/Documents/report.txt):
Documents/report.txt
