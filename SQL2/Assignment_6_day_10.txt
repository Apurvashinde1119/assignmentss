Craft a query using an INNER JOIN to combine 'orders' and 'customers' tables for customers in a specified region, and a LEFT JOIN to display all customers including those without orders.


SELECT *
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
WHERE customers.region = 'specified_region';


SELECT *
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
