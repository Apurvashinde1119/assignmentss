3.Write a script that reads numbers from the user until they
              enter '0'. The script should also print whether each number is odd or even.



#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter numbers (enter '0' to stop):"

while true; do
    read -p "Enter a number: " number

    # Check if the input is '0' to stop the loop
    if [ "$number" -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Exiting..."
        break
    fi

    # Check if the number is odd or even
    if [ $((number % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "$number is even"
    else
        echo "$number is odd"
    fi
done
